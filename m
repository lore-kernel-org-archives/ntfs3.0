Kernel NTFS driver changed more times, so I would not say that it is too
late to stop publishing NTFS creation time in STATX_BTIME, and start
publishing it in STATX_PTIME.


Anyway, I have another idea (if stopping publishing of NTFS is not possible):
Let fs drivers to fill ptime and btime members only when fs itself
supports particular field (ext4 would fill only btime, nfts would fill
only ptime; btrfs with patch would fill both). For userspace STATX_BTIME
request, VFS will copy ptime to btime if the btime is not provided.
For userspace STATX_PTIME request or STATX_BTIME|STATX_PTIME request,
the VFS will not do this copy. Or We can introduce new flag
STATX_NO_FAKE_BTIME (just random name for now) and this would cause that
the ptime would not be copied to btime (so it would not be needed to
misuse STATX_BTIME|STATX_PTIME). The logic would be unified in VFS
layer, not in the fs drivers.
