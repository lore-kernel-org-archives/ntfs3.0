Not related to these changes, but I think it would make sense to adjust
also utimensat man page documentation and mention there what kind of
syscall/function will be used for changing ptime. From my experience,
such cross reference can help developers. Also the fact is that FreeBSD
changes birth time via utimes syscall could mean that developers could
look for similar Linux functionality in linux utime* manpages.
