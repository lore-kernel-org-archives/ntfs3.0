That is good question and I do not have any definite answer how should
Linux handle it.

The reason is very simple. If you look at the FATTR4_TIME_CREATE in
specification (basically I have copied everything about it in previous
emails) it is short and does not say which one it should be.

I was implementing commercial NFS+SMB server with a hard requirement on
compliance with both protocols at the same time and also interop between
them. So from this my perspective by reading NFS4 spec with knowledge of
how SMB server should behave and how are designed Windows/SMB attributes
and permissions into NFS4, if I was asked to which of "ptime" or "btime"
I should map the FATTR4_TIME_CREATE then I would say it is "ptime".
Reasons: all those time attributes are R/W (like in SMB/Windows),
all of them require WRITE_ATTRIBUTES acl permission (like in SMB/Windows)
and we somehow agreed that Windows "create time" matches the "ptime",
and also because the request from from SMB to change create time would
not result in changing the linux "immutable btime". Basically in that
