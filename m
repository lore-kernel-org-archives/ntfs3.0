Ok, if the point is that ext4 btime must stay immutable then it is a bad idea.

FreeBSD for some fs allow it too (see below).

I think that it is important to first define behavior and invariants of
these "btime" and "ptime" kernel properties.

If we want to be consistent then there are two possible options:

1. If we choose that the STATX_BTIME is immutable then no kernel fs
   driver should allow to change.

2. If we choose that the "NTFS create time" is reported via STATX_BTIME
   then STATX_BTIME is not immutable at all.

These two options cannot be chosen together because option 1 would
implie that the modifiable "NTFS create time" cannot be reported over
STATX_BTIME.

We are have currently STATX_BTIME immutable and "NTFS create time"
reported via STATX_BTIME.

If we want to stay _consistent_ across fs drivers then adding API for
changing "NTFS create time" would break one of those two things.

In my opinion we should stay consistent across filesystem drivers and
provide unified behavior of APIs independently of used filesystem.
Otherwise userspace applications would have to write fs specific code
for doing their use cases (and we can stay with fs-specific xattrs, no
need to create unified APIs).

Does it make sense? Or it is still a bad idea to think about it in this way?

Another two facts check:

FreeBSD has also API for changing "birth (creation) times".
It is documented in utimes(2) manpage:
https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=utimes&sektion=2

So I guess that there has to be some tool which is using this API and
therefore these "birth (creation) times" are preserved.


NFS4 has time_create attribute (FATTR4_TIME_CREATE=50) which is
per-fs-object read-write attribute and defined (in RFC8881 5.8.2.40.) as:
  The time of creation of the object. This attribute does not have any
  relation to the traditional UNIX file attribute "ctime" or "change time".
Since NFSv4.1 it can be even specified during creating a new file/dir
which seems to be for backup-restore. And permissions (RFC8881 6.2.1.3.1.):
  ACE4_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES
  Operation(s) affected: SETATTR of time_access_set, time_backup,
    time_create, time_modify_set, mimetype, hidden, system
  Discussion: Permission to change the times associated with a file or
    directory to an arbitrary value. Also permission to change the
    mimetype, hidden, and system attributes. A user having ACE4_WRITE_DATA
    or ACE4_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES will be allowed to set the times associated
    with a file to the current server time.

I'm not sure if there is some backup/restore tool which do it over NFS4
but the NFS4 description seems to be very clear that the network protocol
itself is already prepared for these use cases. And permissions mostly
matches the SMB / NTFS / Windows security model.

I agree here. I also heard lot of times that users (customers) want to
preserve create time in backups and be able to restore it. And that
Windows is already able to do it, Linux not yet.

Maybe what is a "vague" here is where that "create time" is stored and
from which (API) source is GUI (or CLI) application showing it to user.

I think the part "being preserved across tar/cp/filesystems" is
relevant. If a completely new API is introduced into Linux then it means
that every existing backup tool would not be able to preserve this
property and also would not be able to restore it.

I'm not sure if we can do anything with this issue, but it is important
to know about this limitation.

About the part "introduce a herculean effort of changing all of the
system calls and on-disk formats for every filesystem.". In my opinion
it is better to do that cleanup (maybe even in all stat-related
syscalls) if it makes things easier and prevents another technical
issues.

I would say that xattr does not solve this issue too.
