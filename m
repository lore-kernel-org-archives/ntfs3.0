Yes, this would need a very clear and unambiguous documentation because
otherwise it would not be clear for developers how to use such API.

Yes, this is another argument why to rather stop publishing NTFS
creation time in STATX_BTIME (of course if it is possible).

Every compromise has something good and something bad.
I'm just trying to brainstorm ideas and possible solutions.
