Decompression in-place mainly optimizes full decompression (so that CPU
cache line won't be polluted by temporary buffers either), in fact,
EROFS supports the hybird way.

Personally I'm very familiar with LZ4, LZMA, and DEFLATE
algorithm internals, and I also have experience to build LZMA,
DEFLATE compressors.

It's totally workable for LZ4, in short it will read the compressed
data at the end of the decompressed buffers, and the proper margin
can make this almost always succeed.  In practice, many Android
devices already use EROFS for almost 7 years and it works very well
to reduce extra memory overhead and help overall runtime performance.

In short, I don't think EROFS will change since it's already
optimal and gaining more and more users.

I think one of the btrfs supported algorithm LZO is not, because the
fastest LZ77-family algorithms like LZ4, LZO just operates on virtual
consecutive buffers and treat the decompressed buffer as LZ77 sliding
window.

So that either you need to allocate another temporary consecutive
buffer (I believe that is what btrfs does) or use vmap() approach,
EROFS is interested in the vmap() one.
