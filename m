Right, I don't have a strong personal preference either way, so I'll
wait for more feedback (so there's also less diff between v3 and v4).

I also agree that FATTR4_TIME_CREATE should map to ptime, mainly because
in the spec you posted it says it's user-settable with the right
permissions, while btime wouldn't be (and semantically it wouldn't make
sense to be able to, considering btime means "inode creation time").
