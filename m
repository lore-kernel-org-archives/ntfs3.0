SMB for timestamps has exactly same meaning and storage format as NTFS.
So it should be pretty straightforward what to do with it.
NFS3 does not have btime at all. And NFS4 has FATTR4_TIME_CREATE attr
which I described in previous email (there is no more info). So based on
the decision of 1 or 2, that NFS4 attr would either map to btime or ptime.

My personal opinion is 2) because the btime stay immutable also in
userspace and is also more correct semantically.

Another argument why 2) should be less breaking change: Userspace
applications have to already expect that the btime is not filled at all
(e.g. when filesystem does not support it or when application is running
on older kernel version without such support).

My opinion is that if the _new_ API provides two different timestamps
based on the filesystem then we should report it as is, so userspace can
decide how to want to process them. For example full 1:1 clone backup
application would want to preserve both btime and ptime and correctly
indicate if one of them is not available (e.g. because underlying fs
support only one of those times, like NTFS). And such full 1:1 clone
backup application do not want to "invent" some unavailable values.
Option 1) would not allow to do that for such applications.

> And both break at least 1 existing script anyway (as per https://xkcd.com/1172/).

Yes. And that is because we want a new feature which allows changing
something which was immutable. So we need to handle it somehow.

If having two btime and ptime fields would be the direction then we can
propose an extension for NFS4 protocol with a new attribute (as NFS4 has
currently only one). There are already some NFS4 extensions which comes
from Linux or was inspired, e.g. umask or xattr support.
