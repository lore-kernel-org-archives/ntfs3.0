At least the typical EROFS compresses variable-sized plaintext (at least
one block, e.g. 4k, but also 4k+1, 4k+2, ...) into fixed-sized compressed
blocks for efficient I/Os, which is really useful for small compression
granularity (e.g. 4KiB, 8KiB) because use cases like Android are usually
under memory pressure so large compression granularity is almost
unacceptable in the low memory scenarios, see:
https://erofs.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/design.html

Currently EROFS works pretty well on these devices and has been
successfully deployed in billions of real devices.

I don't see this will work for EROFS because EROFS always supports
variable uncompressed extent lengths and that will break typical
EROFS use cases and on-disk formats.

Other thing is that large order folios (physical consecutive) will
caused "increase the latency on UX task with filemap_fault()"
because of high-order direct reclaims, see:
https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/kernel/common/+/3692333
so EROFS will not set min-order and always support order-0 folios.

I think EROFS will not use this new approach, vmap() interface is
always the case for us.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
