btime currently is also a fliesystem specific implementation tho, and
there was already a transition from stat to statx when btime was added,
so I think ptime should be included in statx, especially since it should
be treated as one of the standard timestamps from now on (or at least,
that's what I hope to achieve eventually).
The only difference to the currently standard timestamps would be that
a/mtime are managed by utimensat, ctime/btime by the filesystems
themselves (as they're more "internal" and less "user-facing") and ptime
would be managed by file_[gs]etattr() (since changing utimensat wouldn't
make sense as said in the april thread).
