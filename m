Thanks. This is useful. There's some stuff that I already took care in
v2 fwiw.

Indeed. Fixing that.

Meh, let me think. I think not renaming them back to proc_{read,write}
at the end is ok. Not my favorite but it will cause the compiler to
yell.

Fixed in v2.

Gone in v2 as there's a simpler way to do it like kernfs.

v2 does both.

Right.

Right.

That's a generic problem for nearly all of procfs and is another series
I have but I don't want to get chased with pitchforks.

I'll kill it.

Right.

Yeah, that's in v2 and I think someone else also sent a fix for this.

Yay, more bugfixes... You share the blame for more mail traffic now.

Right, I can probably also cook something up.
